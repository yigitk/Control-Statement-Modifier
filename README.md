# Control-Statement-Parse
 
A tool for making predicates for control statements variables. Used for our research for java subject programs.

Takes 2 paramaters: 

- Param 1: Output directory path (file is generated by the same name as input Java file).
- Param 2: Input file path. (This can be a single Java file or a directory)

Outputs: 

- Any Java file, f ,it's predicates transformed to be variables and ordered from top to bottom; P\_0 ... P\_N, where N is the total number of predicates in a single file. (This is done in place)
- your_output_Path/f.txt, shows the predicate name, predicate evaluation cause and line number. 

Requirements:
- Apache Maven 3.6+ - http://maven.apache.org/
- Java 8+ - https://www.java.com/en/download/
